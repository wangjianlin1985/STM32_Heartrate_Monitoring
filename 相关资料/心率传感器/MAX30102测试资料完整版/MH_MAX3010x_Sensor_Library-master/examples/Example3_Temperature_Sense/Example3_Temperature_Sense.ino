  MAX3010 Breakout: Read the onboard temperature sensor

  This demo outputs the onboard temperature sensor. The temp sensor is accurate to +/-1 C but
  has an astonishing precision of 0.0625 C.

  Hardware Connections (Breakoutboard to Arduino):
  -5V = 5V (3.3V is allowed)
  -GND = GND
  -SDA = A4 (or SDA)
  -SCL = A5 (or SCL)
  -INT = Not connected
 
  The MAX30105 Breakout can handle 5V or 3.3V I2C logic. We recommend powering the board with 5V
  but it will also run at 3.3V.

  //The LEDs are very low power and won't affect the temp reading much but
  //you may want to turn off the LEDs to avoid any local heating
  particleSensor.setup(0); //Configure sensor. Turn off LEDs
  //particleSensor.setup(); //Configure sensor. Use 25mA for LED drive
}

  float temperature = particleSensor.readTemperature();

  Serial.print("temperatureC=");
  Serial.print(temperature, 4);

  float temperatureF = particleSensor.readTemperatureF(); //Because I am a bad global citizen

  Serial.print(" temperatureF=");
  Serial.print(temperatureF, 4);

  Serial.println();
